 INDICATION:  Nasal intubation, cervical mass, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:56 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an
 endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube projects 6.5 cm above the carina.
 
 The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, predominating on the right, have
 slightly increased in extent, and now leads to blunting of the right
 costophrenic sinus.  This underlines the suspicion of pneumonia, as expressed
 in the previous report.
 
 No other changes.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.

 Bibasilar opacification is consistent with layering effusions and underlying
 compressive atelectasis.  Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is
 consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure in this patient
 with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

 Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta are re-

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the region of the cavoatrial junction.  Other indwelling devices are in
 standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for
 patient's rotation.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Bibasilar
 opacities are again demonstrated, with interval worsening in the left
 retrocardiac region, and slight improvement in the right lower lobe, with
 improved visualization of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bilateral
 small-to-moderate pleural effusions are also demonstrated, but there is no
 visible pneumothorax.

 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Rule out CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The patient has a right-sided dialysis line in unchanged position. 
 Sternotomy wires are identified in an unusual position.  There is unchanged
 cardiomegaly.  Wedge-shaped opacification in the right lower lobe is unchanged
 as is pleural blunting and effusion in the left base.  There is only a tiny
 amount of increased peribronchial opacification when compared to the prior
 study.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Loculated fluid right base and chronic fluid in left base.
 
 There is probably a small amount of increased fluid over the prior radiograph.
 There is cardiomegaly and unusually orientated sternal wires probably
 reflecting sternal dehiscence.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the
 image.  An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could
 be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also in the differential as well as massive aspiration.  More confluent right
 upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.  Given that
 the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult
 to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this

 HISTORY:  For ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube measures approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends into the stomach, with the tip crossing the lower margin of the
 image.  Increased opacification is seen at the right base medially.  It is
 unclear whether this represents crowding of pulmonary vessels, atelectasis,
 or, in the appropriate clinical setting, a developing consolidation.

 Low lung volumes explain bronchovascular crowding, but make it difficult to

 atelectasis in the left lower lobe simulating consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is exaggerated by
 low lung volume.  Electrode passes from the left low pectoral power pack to

 pleural effusion cannot be excluded given the interval increase in the

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fatigue and decreased appetite.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Subtle
 patchy right base opacities in the region of skinfold may be due to overlying
 soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The left lung is clear.  Overall, the lungs are

 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subtle patchy opacity at the right lung base in the region of
 overlying skinfold may be due to overlying structures; however, early
 infectious process or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical

 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of a right pleural catheter with associated
 decrease in size of right pleural effusion, and no visible apical
 pneumothorax.  A horizontal interface in the lower right hemithorax just
 medial to the site of the pleural catheter could reflect a loculated basilar
 hydropneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for
 differences in lung volumes.  Bilateral pulmonary lung nodules are again
 visualized, in keeping with metastatic disease.  Destructive right rib lesions
 are seen to better detail on recent CT.

 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 right costophrenic angle is not included on the images.  Again seen is a large
 area of right mid-to-lower lung opacity which is better assessed on prior CT
 from ___.  There is a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying
 atelectasis, an underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Streaky and
 fibrotic opacities are seen in the right lung involving the upper, mid and
 lower lung fields, most noted in the left mid lung field, also seen on the
 prior study.  Left apical pleural thickening and calcifications are again
 seen, consistent with chronic change.  No large left pleural effusion is seen.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 Multiple old right-sided rib deformities/fractures are again seen.  A left

 large area of right mid-to-lower lung opacity is again seen, likely
