 FINDINGS:  Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in
 the region of the cavoatrial junction.  Other indwelling devices are in
 standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for
 patient's rotation.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  Bibasilar
 opacities are again demonstrated, with interval worsening in the left
 retrocardiac region, and slight improvement in the right lower lobe, with
 improved visualization of the right hemidiaphragm.  Bilateral
 small-to-moderate pleural effusions are also demonstrated, but there is no
 visible pneumothorax.

 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Rule out CHF.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:  The patient has a right-sided dialysis line in unchanged position. 
 Sternotomy wires are identified in an unusual position.  There is unchanged
 cardiomegaly.  Wedge-shaped opacification in the right lower lobe is unchanged
 as is pleural blunting and effusion in the left base.  There is only a tiny
 amount of increased peribronchial opacification when compared to the prior
 study.  There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Loculated fluid right base and chronic fluid in left base.
 
 There is probably a small amount of increased fluid over the prior radiograph.
 There is cardiomegaly and unusually orientated sternal wires probably
 reflecting sternal dehiscence.

 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the
 image.  An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could
 be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also in the differential as well as massive aspiration.  More confluent right
 upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.  Given that
 the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult
 to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this

 HISTORY:  For ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube measures approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric
 tube extends into the stomach, with the tip crossing the lower margin of the
 image.  Increased opacification is seen at the right base medially.  It is
 unclear whether this represents crowding of pulmonary vessels, atelectasis,
 or, in the appropriate clinical setting, a developing consolidation.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Subtle
 patchy right base opacities in the region of skinfold may be due to overlying
 soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the

 pneumothorax.  A horizontal interface in the lower right hemithorax just
 medial to the site of the pleural catheter could reflect a loculated basilar
 hydropneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for
 differences in lung volumes.  Bilateral pulmonary lung nodules are again
 visualized, in keeping with metastatic disease.  Destructive right rib lesions
 are seen to better detail on recent CT.

 Pulmonary edema is mild, if any.  Opacification of the base of the left lung
 has been present for several days, probably atelectasis.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is longstanding, but what is most striking is enlargement of the
 left pulmonary artery, which has exceeded and persisted beyond that of the
 right pulmonary artery.  Since this is sometimes a sign of pulmonary embolus
 that diagnosis should be considered and will be discussed with house officer
 caring for this patient.  Tip of the ET tube is approximately 9 cm above the

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, worsening opacification is present
 in the lower left hemi thorax, difficult to fully assess due to marked
 leftward patient rotation.  This likely represents a combination of small left
 pleural effusion adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis and or consolidation. 
 Appearance of the chest is otherwise similar to the prior study when
 consideration is made for the degree of rotation.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest demonstrates increased left lung
 opacification with some minimal residual aerated lung at the left lung apex
 with leftward mediastinal shift suggesting left lower lobe collapse. 
 Right-sided pleural catheter remains in place.  Increased interstitial
 markings seen throughout the lungs and are more conspicuous when compared to

 REPORT:
 Compared to the prior study, the cardiac silhouette is not significantly
 changed given that the prior study was an AP radiograph and today's is a PA
 radiograph.  This would suggest that the silhouette has actually increased in
 size.
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions noted slightly smaller on the right

 markings at the hila bilaterally and some unchanged opacification at the right
 mid zone.  The visualized osseous structures show multilevel degenerative
 changes in the spine.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased right infrahilar opacity could reflect
 aspiration and pneumonia.  There appears to be mild peribronchiolar
 thickening.  The minor fissure with is depressed, suggesting some degree of
 atelectasis in the right lung.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lung may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Background
 hyperlucency of the lungs suggests emphysema.  An approximately 5 mm the
 opacity in this periphery of the right midlung could be a vessel on and,
 however pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Probable 4-mm calcified
 granuloma in the left periphery of the lung.

 HISTORY:  ___ placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with
 interstitial edema.  There is opacification at the left base, with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm, in an unusual configuration.  The appearance raises
 question of a large gastric and/or diaphragmatic hernia.  
 
 An NG tube is present, the tip extends to the level of the lower mediastinum
 and overlies the left upper quadrant near the expected site of the physiologic
 diaphragm.  A left effusion cannot be excluded.  There is minimal atelectasis
 at the right base and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.
 2.  Interstitial edema.
 3.  Atypical opacity in the left mid and lower zones raising the question of
 gastric and/or diaphragmatic hernia.  NG tube as described.  This appearance
 is similar to ___ at 12:24 p.m.  If clinically indicated, abdominal CT
 could help for further assessment.

 AP chest radiograph
 
 Chest tube is in place with interval resolution of the pneumothorax.  The ET
 tube tip is too proximal, about 10 cm above the carina and should be further
 advanced.  The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach.  Small amount of right
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded given the interval increase in the
 opacification of the right hemithorax in a diffuse manner.

 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the

 the level of the carina.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could
 be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also in the differential as well as massive aspiration.  More confluent right
 upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.  Given that
 the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult
 to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this

 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 17 58
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval appearance of pulmonary mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. More focal patchy opacity
 at both bases may reflect compressive atelectasis especially as there are
 small layering pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be excluded and therefore followup imaging should be
 considered based on the clinical assessment. No evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  Calcific density overlying the body of the left scapula
 consistent with known sub scapularis calcific tendinitis.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 The lungs are appreciably lower in volume today, and greater relative
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragm suggests abnormality at the base of the
 right lung could be atelectasis alone, but recent aspiration and early
 pneumonia should certainly be considered.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 although mediastinal veins are more distended than before.  Pleural effusion
 is minimal on the right, if any.  The heart size is normal.  No pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Subtle
 patchy right base opacities in the region of skinfold may be due to overlying
 soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the

 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 In comparison to prior study, ill-defined opacities are again seen projecting
 over the right upper lobe and left upper lobe laterally.  The lung bases
 remain clear.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms suggesting underlying COPD.  There is no effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  Degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Little change in ill-defined bilateral upper lobe opacities compared to one
 day prior.  The chronicity of these remains indeterminate.  Early pneumonia
 could be considered in the proper clinical setting, though this could
 represent chronic scarring.  Comparison with more remote imaging is
 recommended.

 postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.  There is a moderate amount of
 free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.  Left hemidiaphragm is elevated and
 there is patchy opacity at the left base which may reflect atelectasis or
 chronic postoperative changes, although an acute infectious process cannot be
 excluded.  Clinical correlation is advised.  There is no evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax.  Several surgical clips are seen in the left upper
 quadrant.  Streaky linear opacity at the right base most likely reflects
 atelectasis.  A portion of an aortic stent is visualized in the mid abdomen.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the
 image.  An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could
 be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also in the differential as well as massive aspiration.  More confluent right
 upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.  Given that
 the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult
 to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this
 study.

 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the
 image.  An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could
 be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also in the differential as well as massive aspiration.  More confluent right
 upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.  Given that
 the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult
 to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this
 study.
"
"                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 The mass like quality of the opacity above the left hilus and the accompanying
 change in the contour of the aortic arch which raises the possibility of
 lymphadenopathy strongly indicates that follow up is necessary to exclude
 malignancy.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with cough and malaise, history of
 COPD, any pulmonary infiltrates?
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study ___ ___.  The heart size remains unchanged and is within
 normal limits.  No typical configurational abnormality is seen.  Mild widening
 and elongation of the thoracic aorta is noted as before.  No local contour
 abnormalities are seen.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  There is
 now a sizable parenchymal infiltrate occupying the left upper lobe as seen on
 the frontal view.  The lateral view discloses its location in the posterior
 apical segment of the left upper lobe sparing; however, the lingula.  No other
 pulmonary acute processes are seen and the right and left lateral as well as
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation.  Similar as on
 the preceding examination, the general configuration of pulmonary vasculature
 and thorax with increased depth diameter and low positioned diaphragms is
 consistent with COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of acute parenchymal infiltrate in left upper lobe
 lateral and apical segment consistent with pneumonia.  Followup examination
 after successful treatment is recommended.

 HISTORY:  Vagal nerve stimulator battery change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Low lung volumes explain bronchovascular crowding, but make it difficult to
 exclude mild interstitial edema.  It also is likely responsible for
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe simulating consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is exaggerated by
 low lung volume.  Electrode passes from the left low pectoral power pack to
 the left paraspinal neck.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST:
 
 In comparison to prior study, ill-defined opacities are again seen projecting
 over the right upper lobe and left upper lobe laterally.  The lung bases
 remain clear.  The lungs are hyperexpanded, with flattening of the
 hemidiaphragms suggesting underlying COPD.  There is no effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is no
 pulmonary vascular congestion or edema.  Degenerative changes are seen in the
 thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Little change in ill-defined bilateral upper lobe opacities compared to one
 day prior.  The chronicity of these remains indeterminate.  Early pneumonia
 could be considered in the proper clinical setting, though this could
 represent chronic scarring.  Comparison with more remote imaging is
 recommended.
 
 Hyperinflation compatible with known COPD.

 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Background
 hyperlucency of the lungs suggests emphysema.  An approximately 5 mm the
 opacity in this periphery of the right midlung could be a vessel on and,
 however pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Probable 4-mm calcified
 granuloma in the left periphery of the lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Right lower lobe opacity could reflect pneumonia in the appropriate
 clinical situation.  Close interval follow-up after treatment is recommended. 
 This patient could benefit from a non-emergent Chest CT if he has not had any
 before.
 2.  Background emphysema.
 3.  Possible 5 mm right peripheral mid lung nodule versus a vascular marking. 
 Correlate with any prior imaging.

 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post cardiac arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the
 image.  An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above
 the level of the carina.  There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could
 be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is
 also in the differential as well as massive aspiration.  More confluent right
 upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying
 consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.  Given that
 the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult
 to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top
 normal to mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this
 study.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  Subtle
 patchy right base opacities in the region of skinfold may be due to overlying
 soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the

 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man presenting with hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior relevant imaging is available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  Increased right infrahilar opacity could reflect
 aspiration and pneumonia.  There appears to be mild peribronchiolar
 thickening.  The minor fissure with is depressed, suggesting some degree of
 atelectasis in the right lung.  Streaky opacities in the left lower lung may
 reflect atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Background
 hyperlucency of the lungs suggests emphysema.  An approximately 5 mm the
 opacity in this periphery of the right midlung could be a vessel on and,
 however pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded.  Probable 4-mm calcified
 granuloma in the left periphery of the lung.
